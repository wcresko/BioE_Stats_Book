Created in the early 1990s as an open-source implementation of the S language, R has become the lingua franca of statistical analysis in academia and is widely used in industry as well.\n\nSeveral features make R particularly well-suited for data analysis. It provides an extensive collection of statistical and graphical techniques built into the language. It is powerful, flexible, and completely free. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, so your code will work across platforms. New capabilities are constantly being added through packages contributed by the community, with thousands of packages available for specialized analyses.\n\nR excels at reproducibility. You can keep your scripts to document exactly what analyses you performed. Unlike point-and-click software where actions leave no trace, R code provides a complete record of your analytical workflow. This record can be shared with collaborators, included in publications, and revisited years later when you need to remember how you produced a particular result.\n\nYou can write your own functions in R, extending the language to meet your specific needs. Extensive online help and active user communities mean that answers to most questions are a web search away. The RStudio integrated development environment makes working with R much more pleasant, especially for newcomers. And with tools like R Markdown and Quarto, you can embed your analyses in polished documents, presentations, websites, and books—this book itself was created with these tools.\n\n## Installing R and RStudio\n\nR must be installed before RStudio. Download R from [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org), selecting the version appropriate for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions for your platform.\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier. Download the free RStudio Desktop from [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com). RStudio provides a console for running R commands, an editor for writing scripts, tools for viewing plots and data, and integration with version control systems.\n\nAfter installing both programs, launch RStudio. You will see a window divided into panes, each serving a different purpose. The console pane is where R commands are executed. The source pane is where you edit scripts and documents. The environment pane shows what objects currently exist in your R session. The files/plots/packages/help pane provides access to various utilities.\n\n## R Basics\n\nR evaluates expressions and returns results. You can use it as a calculator by typing arithmetic expressions at the console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n4 * 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 16\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(4 + 3 * 2^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that R follows standard mathematical order of operations: exponentiation before multiplication and division, which come before addition and subtraction. Parentheses can override this ordering.\n\n## Variables and Assignment\n\nMore useful than evaluating isolated expressions is storing values in variables for later use. Variables are assigned using the `<-` operator (a less-than sign followed by a hyphen).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 2\nx * 3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- x * 3\ny - 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVariable names must begin with a letter but can contain letters, numbers, periods, and underscores after the first character. R is case-sensitive, so `myVariable`, `MyVariable`, and `myvariable` are three different names. Choose descriptive names that make your code readable.\n\nNote that when you assign a value to a variable, R does not print anything. To see a variable's value, type its name alone or use the `print()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- 100\nz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 100\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(z)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 100\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Functions\n\nFunctions are the workhorses of R. A function takes inputs (called arguments), performs some operation, and returns an output. R has many built-in functions, and packages provide thousands more.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.302585\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(16)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.718282\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFunctions are called by typing their name followed by parentheses containing their arguments. Many functions accept multiple arguments, separated by commas. Arguments can be specified by position or by name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.14\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(3.14159, 2)  # same result, argument specified by position\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.14\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo learn about a function, use the help system. Type `?functionname` or `help(functionname)` to open the documentation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?round\nhelp(sqrt)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Vectors\n\nThe fundamental data structure in R is the vector, an ordered collection of values of the same type. You create vectors using the `c()` function (for concatenate or combine).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nnumbers\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames <- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Carol\")\nnames\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Alice\" \"Bob\"   \"Carol\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMany operations in R are vectorized, meaning they operate on entire vectors at once rather than requiring you to loop through elements.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers * 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers + 10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 11 12 13 14 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers^2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1  4  9 16 25\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can access individual elements using square brackets with an index (R uses 1-based indexing, so the first element is at position 1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers[c(1, 3, 5)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 3 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Creating Sequences\n\nR provides convenient functions for creating regular sequences.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1:10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(0, 10, by = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  0  2  4  6  8 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(0, 1, length.out = 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(1, times = 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(c(1, 2), times = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 1 2 1 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Generating Random Numbers\n\nR can generate random numbers from various probability distributions, which is invaluable for simulation and understanding statistical concepts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Draw 1000 values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 10\nx <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 10)\nhist(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-r-rstudio_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Draw from a binomial distribution: 1000 experiments, 20 trials each, p=0.5\nheads <- rbinom(n = 1000, size = 20, prob = 0.5)\nhist(heads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-r-rstudio_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `set.seed()` function allows you to make random simulations reproducible by initializing the random number generator to a known state.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(42)\nrnorm(5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1.3709584 -0.5646982  0.3631284  0.6328626  0.4042683\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(42)  # same seed produces same \"random\" numbers\nrnorm(5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1.3709584 -0.5646982  0.3631284  0.6328626  0.4042683\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data Frames\n\nData frames are R's structure for tabular data—rows of observations and columns of variables.

Type your commands in the script editor, and run them by placing your cursor on a line and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac) or by selecting code and clicking Run.\n\nScripts should be self-contained, including all the commands needed to reproduce your analysis from start to finish. Begin scripts by loading required packages, then reading data, then performing analyses. Add comments (lines beginning with `#`) to explain what your code does and why.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Analysis of hydrogel mechanical properties\n# Author: Your Name\n# Date: 2025-04-01\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read data\ndata <- read.csv(\"hydrogel_data.csv\")\n\n# Calculate summary statistics\nsummary(data)\n\n# Create visualization\nggplot(data, aes(x = concentration, y = compression)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Getting Help\n\nWhen you encounter problems, R provides several resources. The `?` operator opens documentation for functions. The `help.search()` function searches the help system for topics. The `example()` function runs examples from a function's documentation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?mean\nhelp.search(\"regression\")\nexample(plot)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBeyond R's built-in help, the internet offers vast resources. Stack Overflow has answers to almost any R question you can imagine. Package vignettes provide tutorials for specific packages. The RStudio community forums are welcoming to beginners.\n\nWhen asking for help online, provide a minimal reproducible example—the smallest piece of code that demonstrates your problem, including sample data. This makes it much easier for others to understand and solve your issue.\n",
