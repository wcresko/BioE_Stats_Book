## The Bootstrap Idea

For the sample mean, we have elegant formulas for standard errors and confidence intervals derived from probability theory. But what about other statistics—the median, a correlation coefficient, the ratio of two means? For many estimators, no convenient formula exists.

The bootstrap [@efron1979bootstrap], invented by Bradley Efron in 1979, provides a general solution. The key insight is that we can learn about the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling from our data. If our sample is representative of the population, then samples drawn from our sample (with replacement) mimic what we would get from repeated sampling from the population.

![Bootstrap resampling procedure showing how multiple samples are drawn with replacement from the original data](../images/week_2.030.jpeg){#fig-bootstrap-resampling fig-align="center"}

## Why the Bootstrap Works

The bootstrap treats the observed sample as if it were the population. By drawing many samples with replacement from this "population," we create a distribution of the statistic of interest. This bootstrap distribution approximates the true sampling distribution.

The bootstrap standard error is the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. Bootstrap confidence intervals can be constructed from the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution—the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles give an approximate 95% confidence interval.

## Bootstrap Procedure

The basic algorithm is straightforward:

1. Draw a random sample of size n from your data with replacement (the bootstrap sample)
2. Calculate the statistic of interest from this bootstrap sample
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 many times (1000 or more)
4. Use the distribution of bootstrap statistics to estimate standard error or confidence intervals

```{r}
#| label: fig-bootstrap-dist
#| fig-cap: "Bootstrap distribution of the median from 1000 resamples, showing the estimated sampling distribution with 95% confidence intervals"
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
# Bootstrap example: estimating standard error of median
set.seed(42)
original_data <- rexp(50, rate = 0.1)  # Skewed distribution

# Observed median
observed_median <- median(original_data)

# Bootstrap
n_boot <- 1000
boot_medians <- replicate(n_boot, {
  boot_sample <- sample(original_data, replace = TRUE)
  median(boot_sample)
})

# Bootstrap standard error
boot_se <- sd(boot_medians)

# Bootstrap confidence interval (percentile method)
boot_ci <- quantile(boot_medians, c(0.025, 0.975))

cat("Observed median:", round(observed_median, 2), "\n")
cat("Bootstrap SE:", round(boot_se, 2), "\n")
cat("95% CI:", round(boot_ci, 2), "\n")

hist(boot_medians, breaks = 30, main = "Bootstrap Distribution of Median",
     xlab = "Median", col = "lightblue")
abline(v = observed_median, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = boot_ci, col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

## Advantages of the Bootstrap

The bootstrap is remarkably versatile. It can be applied to almost any statistic—means, medians, correlations, regression coefficients, eigenvalues, and more. It works when no formula for standard errors exists. It is nonparametric, making no assumptions about the underlying distribution. It handles complex sampling designs and calculations that would be intractable analytically.

The bootstrap is widely used for assessing confidence in phylogenetic trees, where the complexity of tree-building algorithms makes analytical approaches impractical. In machine learning, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) improves prediction accuracy by combining models trained on bootstrap samples.

## When the Bootstrap Fails

The bootstrap is not a magic solution to all problems. It requires that the original sample be representative of the population—a biased sample produces biased bootstrap estimates. It can struggle with very small samples where the original data may not adequately represent the population.

Certain statistics, like the maximum of a sample, are poorly estimated by the bootstrap because the bootstrap distribution is bounded by the observed data. The bootstrap also assumes that observations are independent; for dependent data (like time series), specialized bootstrap methods are needed.

## Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

Several methods exist for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals. The **percentile method** uses the quantiles of the bootstrap distribution directly. The **basic bootstrap** method reflects the bootstrap distribution around the observed estimate. The **BCa (bias-corrected and accelerated)** method adjusts for bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution.

```{r}
# Different bootstrap CI methods
library(boot)

# Define statistic function
median_fun <- function(data, indices) {
  median(data[indices])
}

# Run bootstrap
boot_result <- boot(original_data, median_fun, R = 1000)

# Different CI methods
boot.ci(boot_result, type = c("perc", "basic", "bca"))
```

The BCa method is generally preferred when computationally feasible, as it provides better coverage in many situations.

## Practical Recommendations

For most applications, 1000 bootstrap replications provide adequate precision for standard errors. For confidence intervals, especially when using the BCa method, 10,000 replications may be preferable. Always set a random seed for reproducibility.

Remember that the bootstrap estimates sampling variability—it cannot fix problems with biased samples or invalid measurements. Use it as a tool for understanding uncertainty, not as a cure for poor data quality.

## Permutation Tests

While the bootstrap estimates sampling variability by resampling **with replacement**, **permutation tests** (also called **randomization tests**) address a different question: they test the null hypothesis by resampling **without replacement**. Permutation tests are among the oldest statistical tests, predating many parametric methods.

### The Permutation Idea

A permutation test asks: "If there were truly no difference between groups, how likely would we be to see a difference as large as the one we observed?"

Under the null hypothesis of no group difference, group labels are arbitrary—the data could have been assigned to either group. A permutation test generates the null distribution by repeatedly shuffling group labels and recalculating the test statistic. The p-value is the proportion of permuted statistics as extreme as the observed statistic.

```{r}
#| label: fig-permutation-concept
#| fig-cap: "Permutation test concept: if group labels don't matter, shuffling them should produce similar results"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

# Example: Two-sample permutation test
set.seed(42)

# Generate two groups with different means
group_A <- rnorm(15, mean = 10, sd = 2)
group_B <- rnorm(15, mean = 12, sd = 2)

# Observed difference in means
observed_diff <- mean(group_B) - mean(group_A)
cat("Observed difference:", round(observed_diff, 3), "\n")

# Combined data for permutation
combined <- c(group_A, group_B)
n_A <- length(group_A)
n_B <- length(group_B)
n_total <- n_A + n_B

# Permutation test
n_perm <- 10000
perm_diffs <- replicate(n_perm, {
  shuffled <- sample(combined)  # Shuffle without replacement
  mean(shuffled[(n_A + 1):n_total]) - mean(shuffled[1:n_A])
})

# Visualize the permutation distribution
hist(perm_diffs, breaks = 50, col = "lightblue",
     main = "Permutation Distribution of Mean Difference",
     xlab = "Difference in Means")
abline(v = observed_diff, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = -observed_diff, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
legend("topright", c("Observed", "Mirror (for two-tailed)"),
       col = "red", lty = c(1, 2), lwd = 2)
```

### Calculating the P-Value

```{r}
# Two-tailed p-value: proportion of permuted differences as extreme as observed
p_value <- mean(abs(perm_diffs) >= abs(observed_diff))
cat("Permutation p-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Compare to t-test
t_test <- t.test(group_B, group_A)
cat("t-test p-value:", round(t_test$p.value, 4), "\n")
```

The permutation p-value and parametric p-value are often similar when parametric assumptions are met. The permutation test is exact—it gives the correct p-value regardless of the underlying distribution.

### Permutation Test for Correlation

Permutation tests work for any test statistic. Here's an example testing whether a correlation is significantly different from zero:

```{r}
#| label: fig-permutation-correlation
#| fig-cap: "Permutation test for correlation: null distribution generated by breaking the X-Y pairing"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

# Test correlation significance
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(25)
y <- 0.5 * x + rnorm(25, sd = 0.8)  # True correlation exists

# Observed correlation
observed_cor <- cor(x, y)
cat("Observed correlation:", round(observed_cor, 3), "\n")

# Permutation test: shuffle one variable to break association
n_perm <- 10000
perm_cors <- replicate(n_perm, {
  cor(x, sample(y))  # Shuffle y, keeping x fixed
})

# Permutation p-value
p_value_cor <- mean(abs(perm_cors) >= abs(observed_cor))
cat("Permutation p-value:", p_value_cor, "\n")

# Visualize
hist(perm_cors, breaks = 50, col = "lightblue",
     main = "Permutation Distribution of Correlation",
     xlab = "Correlation Coefficient")
abline(v = observed_cor, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = -observed_cor, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

### Bootstrap vs Permutation

The bootstrap and permutation tests answer different questions:

| Feature | Bootstrap | Permutation Test |
|:--------|:----------|:-----------------|
| **Question** | What is the sampling variability of my estimate? | Is the observed effect real or due to chance? |
| **Resampling** | With replacement | Without replacement |
| **Output** | Confidence intervals, standard errors | P-value |
| **Null hypothesis** | None assumed | Tests specific null (e.g., no group difference) |
| **Assumptions** | Sample is representative | Observations are exchangeable under null |

**Use bootstrap when:**
- You want confidence intervals for any statistic
- No convenient formula for standard error exists
- You need to assess uncertainty

**Use permutation tests when:**
- You want to test a null hypothesis
- Parametric assumptions may be violated
- You want an exact test without distributional assumptions

### Permutation Test for Paired Data

For paired designs (like before/after measurements), permute the sign of differences rather than shuffling between groups:

```{r}
# Paired permutation test
set.seed(456)
before <- rnorm(20, mean = 100, sd = 15)
after <- before + rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 8)  # Treatment adds ~5 units

# Observed mean difference
differences <- after - before
observed_mean_diff <- mean(differences)
cat("Observed mean difference:", round(observed_mean_diff, 3), "\n")

# Permutation: randomly flip signs of differences
n_perm <- 10000
perm_means <- replicate(n_perm, {
  signs <- sample(c(-1, 1), length(differences), replace = TRUE)
  mean(differences * signs)
})

# P-value
p_value_paired <- mean(abs(perm_means) >= abs(observed_mean_diff))
cat("Permutation p-value:", p_value_paired, "\n")

# Compare to paired t-test
paired_t <- t.test(after, before, paired = TRUE)
cat("Paired t-test p-value:", round(paired_t$p.value, 4), "\n")
```

### When Permutation Tests Excel

Permutation tests are particularly valuable when:

1. **Sample sizes are small**: Parametric tests may not be reliable
2. **Distributions are non-normal**: Especially with skewed or heavy-tailed data
3. **Data are ranks or ordinal**: No parametric distribution applies
4. **Complex test statistics**: Custom statistics without known distributions
5. **You want exact inference**: No approximation error from asymptotic theory

::: {.callout-tip}
## Practical Considerations

- **Number of permutations**: 10,000 is often sufficient; for publishable results, 100,000 gives more precision
- **Computation**: Permutation tests can be slow for large datasets; consider parallel computing
- **Small samples**: With very small samples, the number of unique permutations is limited
- **Exact vs. Monte Carlo**: For small samples, you can enumerate all permutations exactly; for larger samples, random sampling (Monte Carlo) approximates the permutation distribution
:::

### Implementation with coin Package

The `coin` package provides efficient, well-tested permutation tests:

```{r}
library(coin)

# Two-sample permutation test
test_data <- data.frame(
  value = c(group_A, group_B),
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), c(length(group_A), length(group_B))))
)

# Exact permutation test (or Monte Carlo approximation for larger samples)
oneway_test(value ~ group, data = test_data, distribution = "approximate")
```

## Summary

Resampling methods provide powerful, flexible tools for statistical inference:

- **Bootstrap** estimates sampling variability by resampling with replacement from observed data
- **Permutation tests** test null hypotheses by resampling without replacement to generate null distributions
- Both methods make minimal distributional assumptions
- Bootstrap excels at constructing confidence intervals; permutation tests excel at hypothesis testing
- Use 1,000+ replications for bootstrap standard errors; 10,000+ for confidence intervals and p-values
- These methods complement rather than replace traditional parametric approaches
