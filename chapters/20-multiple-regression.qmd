## Beyond One Predictor

Simple linear regression uses a single predictor. But the response variable often depends on multiple factors. A patient's blood pressure might depend on age, weight, sodium intake, and medication. Gene expression might depend on temperature, time, and treatment condition.

Multiple regression extends linear regression to multiple predictors:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon_i$$

## Goals of Multiple Regression

Multiple regression serves two main purposes. First, it often improves prediction by incorporating multiple sources of information. Second, it allows us to investigate the effect of each predictor while controlling for the others—the effect of X1 "holding X2 constant."

This second goal is powerful but requires caution. In observational data, controlling for variables statistically is not the same as controlling them experimentally. Confounding variables you do not measure cannot be controlled.

## Additive vs. Multiplicative Models

An **additive model** assumes predictors contribute independently:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$$

A **multiplicative model** includes interactions—the effect of one predictor depends on the value of another:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon$$

```{r}
# Example with two predictors
set.seed(42)
n <- 100
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2 + 3*x1 + 2*x2 + 1.5*x1*x2 + rnorm(n)

# Additive model
add_model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)

# Model with interaction
int_model <- lm(y ~ x1 * x2)

summary(int_model)
```

## Interpretation of Coefficients

In multiple regression, each coefficient represents the expected change in Y for a one-unit change in that predictor, **holding all other predictors constant**.

This "holding constant" interpretation makes the coefficients different from what you would get from separate simple regressions. The coefficient for X1 in multiple regression represents the unique contribution of X1 after accounting for X2.

## Multicollinearity

When predictors are correlated with each other, interpreting individual coefficients becomes problematic. This **multicollinearity** inflates standard errors and can make coefficients unstable.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
# Check for multicollinearity visually
library(car)
pairs(~ x1 + x2, main = "Scatterplot Matrix")
```

The **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** quantifies multicollinearity. VIF > 10 suggests serious problems; VIF > 5 warrants attention.

```{r}
vif(int_model)
```

## Model Selection

With many potential predictors, how do we choose which to include? Adding variables always improves fit to the training data but may hurt prediction on new data through overfitting.

Several criteria balance fit and complexity:

**Adjusted R²** penalizes for the number of predictors.

**AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)** estimates prediction error, penalizing complexity. Lower is better.

**BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)** similar to AIC but penalizes complexity more heavily.

```{r}
# Compare models
AIC(add_model, int_model)
BIC(add_model, int_model)
```

## Model Selection Strategies

**Forward selection** starts with no predictors and adds them one at a time based on statistical criteria.

**Backward elimination** starts with all predictors and removes them one at a time.

**All subsets** examines all possible combinations and selects the best.

No strategy is universally best. Automated selection can lead to overfitting and unstable models. Theory-driven model building—starting with predictors you have scientific reasons to include—is often preferable.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial terms can capture non-linear relationships while still using the linear regression framework:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
# Non-linear relationship
x <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
y <- 2 + 0.5*x - 0.1*x^2 + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)

# Fit polynomial models
model1 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 1))  # Linear
model2 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2))  # Quadratic
model3 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 5))  # Degree 5

# Compare
AIC(model1, model2, model3)
```

Higher-degree polynomials fit better but risk overfitting. The principle of parsimony suggests using the simplest adequate model.

## Assumptions

Multiple regression shares assumptions with simple regression: linearity (in each predictor), independence, normality of residuals, and constant variance. Additionally, predictors should not be perfectly correlated (no perfect multicollinearity).

Check assumptions with residual plots. Partial regression plots can help diagnose problems with individual predictors.

## Practical Guidelines

Start with a theoretically motivated model rather than throwing in all available predictors. Check for multicollinearity before interpreting coefficients. Use cross-validation to assess prediction performance. Report standardized coefficients when comparing the relative importance of predictors on different scales.

Be humble about causation. Multiple regression describes associations; experimental manipulation is needed to establish causation.
