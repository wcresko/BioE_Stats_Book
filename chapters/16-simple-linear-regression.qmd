## From Correlation to Prediction

Correlation tells us that two variables are related, but it does not allow us to predict one from the other or to describe the nature of that relationship. Linear regression goes further—it models the relationship between variables, allowing us to make predictions and to quantify how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another.

In simple linear regression, we model a response variable Y as a linear function of a predictor variable X:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$

Here $\beta_0$ is the intercept (the expected value of Y when X equals zero), $\beta_1$ is the slope (how much Y changes for a one-unit change in X), and $\epsilon_i$ represents the random error—the part of Y not explained by X.

## Origins of the Term "Regression"

The term "regression" comes from Francis Galton's studies of heredity in the 1880s. He observed that tall parents tended to have children who were tall, but not as extremely tall as the parents—children's heights "regressed" toward the population mean. This phenomenon, now called regression to the mean, is a statistical artifact that appears whenever two variables are imperfectly correlated.

## Fitting the Model: Ordinary Least Squares

The most common method for fitting a regression line is **ordinary least squares (OLS)**. OLS finds the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals—the squared vertical distances between observed points and the fitted line.

![](../images/images_4b.009.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

The OLS estimates for the slope and intercept are:

$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2} = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$

$$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$$

Notice that the slope equals the correlation coefficient times the ratio of standard deviations. This makes clear the connection between correlation and regression.

## Linear Regression in R

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
# Example: zebrafish size data
set.seed(42)
n <- 100
length_cm <- runif(n, 0.5, 3.5)
weight_mg <- 15 * length_cm^2 + rnorm(n, sd = 10)

# Fit the model
fish_lm <- lm(weight_mg ~ length_cm)
summary(fish_lm)
```

The output shows the estimated coefficients with their standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values. The Multiple R-squared indicates how much of the variance in Y is explained by X.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
# Visualize the fit
plot(length_cm, weight_mg, pch = 19, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Length (cm)", ylab = "Weight (mg)",
     main = "Linear Regression: Weight vs Length")
abline(fish_lm, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Interpretation of Coefficients

The **intercept** $\hat{\beta}_0$ is the predicted value of Y when X equals zero. This may or may not be meaningful depending on whether X = 0 makes sense in your context.

The **slope** $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the predicted change in Y for a one-unit increase in X. If the slope is 15, then each additional unit of X is associated with 15 more units of Y on average.

## Hypothesis Testing in Regression

The hypothesis test for the slope asks whether there is evidence of a relationship between X and Y:

$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \quad \text{(no relationship)}$$
$$H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0 \quad \text{(relationship exists)}$$

The test uses a t-statistic, comparing the estimated slope to its standard error. The p-value indicates the probability of observing a slope this far from zero if the true slope were zero.

## R-Squared: Measuring Model Fit

**R-squared** ($R^2$) measures the proportion of variance in Y explained by the model:

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{error}}{SS_{total}} = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$$

In simple linear regression, $R^2$ equals the square of the correlation coefficient. An $R^2$ of 0.7 means the model explains 70% of the variance in Y; the remaining 30% is unexplained.

Be cautious with $R^2$—it always increases when you add predictors, even useless ones. Adjusted $R^2$ penalizes for model complexity.

## Making Predictions

Once you have a fitted model, you can predict Y for new values of X:

```{r}
# Predict weight for new lengths
new_lengths <- data.frame(length_cm = c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
predict(fish_lm, newdata = new_lengths, interval = "confidence")
```

The confidence interval indicates uncertainty about the mean Y at each X value. A prediction interval (using `interval = "prediction"`) would be wider, accounting for individual variability around that mean.

## Model Assumptions

Linear regression assumptions include:

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between X and Y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
3. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed
4. **Homoscedasticity**: Residuals have constant variance across X

These assumptions should be checked through residual analysis.

## Residual Analysis

**Residuals** are the differences between observed and fitted values: $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$. Examining residuals reveals whether model assumptions are satisfied.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 8
# Residual diagnostic plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fish_lm)
```

Key diagnostic plots:

1. **Residuals vs Fitted**: Should show random scatter around zero. Patterns suggest non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.

2. **Q-Q Plot**: Residuals should fall along the diagonal line if normally distributed. Deviations at the tails indicate non-normality.

3. **Scale-Location**: Should show constant spread. A funnel shape indicates heteroscedasticity.

4. **Residuals vs Leverage**: Identifies influential points. Points with high leverage and large residuals may unduly influence the fit.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
# Example of problematic residuals
set.seed(123)
x_prob <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 50)
y_prob <- x_prob^2 + rnorm(50, sd = 5)  # Quadratic relationship

lm_prob <- lm(y_prob ~ x_prob)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x_prob, y_prob, pch = 19, main = "Data with Non-linear Pattern")
abline(lm_prob, col = "red", lwd = 2)

plot(fitted(lm_prob), residuals(lm_prob), pch = 19,
     xlab = "Fitted values", ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals Show Clear Pattern")
abline(h = 0, col = "red", lty = 2)
```

The curved pattern in the residuals reveals that a linear model is inappropriate—the true relationship is non-linear.

## Model I vs Model II Regression

Standard OLS regression (Model I) assumes X is measured without error and minimizes vertical distances to the line. This is appropriate when:

- X is fixed by the experimenter (controlled variable)
- X is measured with negligible error compared to Y
- The goal is prediction of Y from X

When both variables are measured with error (common in observational studies), **Model II regression** may be more appropriate. Model II methods include:

- **Major Axis (MA) regression**: Minimizes perpendicular distances to the line
- **Reduced Major Axis (RMA)**: Often preferred when both variables have similar measurement error

```{r}
# Model I slope estimate
slope_model1 <- coef(fish_lm)[2]

# Reduced Major Axis slope estimate (ratio of standard deviations)
slope_rma <- sd(weight_mg) / sd(length_cm) * sign(cor(length_cm, weight_mg))

cat("Model I (OLS) slope:", round(slope_model1, 3), "\n")
cat("Model II (RMA) slope:", round(slope_rma, 3), "\n")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## When to Use Model II Regression

Use Model II regression when:
- Both X and Y are random variables measured with error
- You want to describe the relationship rather than predict Y from X
- You need to compare slopes across groups (e.g., allometric scaling)

The `lmodel2` package in R provides Model II regression methods.

## Extrapolation Warning

Regression models should only be used to make predictions within the range of observed X values. **Extrapolation**—predicting beyond this range—is risky because the linear relationship may not hold.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
# Danger of extrapolation
plot(length_cm, weight_mg, pch = 19, col = "blue",
     xlim = c(0, 6), ylim = c(-50, 600),
     xlab = "Length (cm)", ylab = "Weight (mg)",
     main = "Extrapolation Risk")
abline(fish_lm, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = c(min(length_cm), max(length_cm)), col = "gray", lty = 2)

# Mark extrapolation zone
rect(max(length_cm), -50, 6, 600, col = rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.1), border = NA)
text(5, 100, "Extrapolation\nzone", col = "red")
```

## Summary

Simple linear regression models the relationship between a predictor and response variable:

- OLS finds the line minimizing squared residuals
- The slope indicates how Y changes per unit change in X
- R-squared measures proportion of variance explained
- Residual analysis checks model assumptions
- Model II regression is appropriate when both variables have measurement error
- Avoid extrapolating beyond the range of observed data
